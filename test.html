<h1> MLB and NPB Performance based on Pitching and Hitting for 2014 - 2018 </h1>
<p>This visualization aims to looks at baseball statistics for the past 5 seasons including the current season.
<br>
There are many statistics in baseball that could be used to measure pitching and hitting performance. Below we will look at two of the most important measures.
<br> For pitching, Earned Run Average (ERA) will be used which is the average number of runs allowed per 9 innings. For ERA, lower is better. 
<br> For hitting, On Base Percentage (OBP) will be used which measures how frequently a batter will reach a base. For OBP, higher is better.
